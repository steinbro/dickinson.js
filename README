This is a JavaScript reimplementation of "Dickinson in a Box," a short Ruby
script that managed to find its way into a number of university courses on
digital poetics.

Some assembly required: the anthology must be fetched separately (to avoid
keeping a copy in the repository). Just run dickinson.sh to create
dickinson.html, which can then be viewed in a browser without a server
setup.
